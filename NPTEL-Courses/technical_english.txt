Subjects and objects have the opposite functions in a sentence. The subject is the 'doer' of the action. For example, take the sentence “We are watching Netflix.” Here, the subject is the pronoun 'we'. Objects are the opposite; instead of doing something (like watching Netflix), they are acted upon. 	

A sentence follows Subject + Verb + Object word order. He (subject) obtained (verb) his degree (object).

​​A complex sentence is a sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. It works best when you need to provide more information to explain or modify your sentence’s main point.
Ex: It doesn’t matter how slowly you go as long as you don’t stop.

A subordinate clause is a clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. t provides informational support to the main event of the sentence. This main clause will be independent: it can stand on its own as a complete sentence.
ex: We can all go for ice cream if I can find my wallet.

A direct object is a noun that receives the action of the verb. Ex: The students eat cake.
